# Making `Classes`

## Classes

- classes are the basic units of Java programs.

## Valuable info

- classes have public and non public forms
- public classes are visible to other classes
- non public classes are only visible to other classes in the same package

## Class Anatomy
- classes have a body
- the body is surrounded by braces
- the body contains fields and methods
- fields are variables that hold the state of the class
- methods are functions that operate on the state of the class

## constructors
- constructors are special methods that create objects
- constructors have the same name as the class
- constructors have no return type
- constructors are called with the `new` keyword
- constructors can take arguments
- constructors can be overloaded

## default constructors
- by default, classes have a default constructor
- the default constructor takes no arguments
- the default constructor does nothing but invoke a object instance

## static methods
- static methods are methods that are not associated with an object
- static methods are associated with the class itself
- static methods can be called without an object instance
- static methods can be called with the class name
- static methods can only access static fields
- static methods can only call other static methods

## static fields
- static fields are fields that are not associated with an object
- static fields are associated with the class itself
- static fields can be accessed without an object instance
- static fields can be accessed with the class name
- static fields can only access other static fields
- static fields can only call other static methods
