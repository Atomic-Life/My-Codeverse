# Inside your first java program
## The main method
- The main method is the entry point of a Java program.
- The main method is the first method that is executed.
- The main method is declared as `public static void main(String[] args)`.
- The main method is declared inside a class.
- The main method is declared inside a class that is declared as `public`.

- First Java Program
```java
public class FirstJavaProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
- The `public` keyword is an access modifier.
- The `class` keyword is used to declare a class.
- The `FirstJavaProgram` is the name of the class.
- The `static` keyword is used to associate the method with class, but not with specific instance(Object)
- The `main` method is the entry point of the program.
- The `String[] args` is the parameter of the main method.
- The `System.out.println` is used to print a message to the console.
- The `Hello World!` is the message that is printed to the console.
- This is first java class that we have created.

## The `public` keyword
- The `public` keyword is an access modifier.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare a class as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare a method as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare a field as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare a constructor as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare an interface as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare an enumeration as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare an annotation as public.
- The `public` keyword is used to declare a package as public.

## The `static` keyword
- The `static` keyword is used to associate a method with a class, but not with a specific instance of that class.
- The `static` keyword is used to declare a field as static.
- The `static` keyword is used to declare a nested class as static.
- The `static` keyword is used to declare a nested interface as static.
- The `static` keyword is used to declare a nested enumeration as static.
- The `static` keyword is used to declare a nested annotation as static.

## Compilation and running
- The `javac` command is used to compile a Java program.
- The `java` command is used to run a Java program.
- Compilation can be of two types
    1. Application type
    2. Applet type
- After compilation, the `.class` file is generated.
- The `.class` file contains the `bytecode`.
- The bytecode is executed by the JVM.
- The JVM is platform dependent.
- The JVM is responsible for memory management and garbage collection.
- The JVM is responsible for security.
- The JVM is responsible for exception handling.
- The JVM is responsible for loading and linking.
- The JVM is responsible for verifying the bytecode.
- The JVM is responsible for executing the bytecode.
- The `bytecode` is interpreted by the JVM.
- The `bytecode` is platform independent.
- The `bytecode` is secure.
- The `bytecode` is portable.
- The `bytecode` is robust.
- The `bytecode` is distributed.
- The `bytecode` is dynamic.
- The `bytecode` is threaded.
- The `bytecode` is garbage collected.
- The `bytecode` is object oriented.
- The `bytecode` is interpreted.
- The `bytecode` is high performance.
- The `bytecode` is architectural neutral.
- The `bytecode` is extensible.
- The `bytecode` is simple.
- The `bytecode` is familiar.
- The `bytecode` has good processing speed compared to other interpreted languages and reasonabily close to `C/C++`.

## **Java is true object oriented language
- Java is a true object oriented language because it supports all the features of object oriented programming.
- The features of object oriented programming are
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Inheritance
    3. Polymorphism
    4. Abstraction
    5. Association
    6. Aggregation
    7. Composition
    8. Generalization
    9. Realization
    10. Dependency

## The `System` class
- The `System` class is a final class.
- The `System` class is a member of the `java.lang` package.
- The `System` class is used to access the standard input, output and error streams.
- The `System` class consists of out, in and err fields.
- The `System.out` is a static field.
- The `System.out` is of type `PrintStream`.
- The `System.out` is used to print the output to the console.
- The `System.in` is a static field.
- The `System.in` is of type `InputStream`.
- The `System.in` is used to read the input from the console.
- The `System.err` is a static field.
- The `System.err` is of type `PrintStream`.
- The `System.err` is used to print the error to the console.

## Methods in `System` class
- The `System` class consists of several methods.
- The `System` class consists of `currentTimeMillis()` method.
- The `System` class consists of `nanoTime()` method.
- The `System` class consists of `arraycopy()` method.
- The `System` class consists of `exit()` method.
