## Classes
- classes are the basic units of Java programs. A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
- A class is a collection of fields and methods that operate on those fields.

## Objects
- Objects are an instance of a class.
- Objects are created from a class using the `new` keyword.
- Objects are created on the heap.
- Objects are accessed through references.
- Objects are destroyed by the garbage collector.

## Methods
- Methods are functions that are associated with a class.
- Methods are invoked on objects.
- Methods can be overloaded.
- Methods can be overridden.

## Fields
- Fields are variables that are associated with a class.
- Fields are also called instance variables.
- Fields are declared inside a class, but outside of any method.
- Fields are initialized when an object is created.
- Fields are accessed through objects.

## Constructors
- Constructors are special methods that are used to initialize objects.
- Constructors have the same name as the class.
- Constructors do not have a return type.
- Constructors are invoked using the `new` keyword.
- Constructors can be overloaded.

## Interfaces
- Interfaces are a collection of abstract methods.
- Interfaces are used to define a protocol.
- Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction.
- Interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritance.
- Interfaces are used to achieve loose coupling.

## Packages
- Packages are used to organize classes.
- Packages are used to avoid naming conflicts.
- Packages are used to control access.
- Packages are used to achieve abstraction.
- Packages are used to achieve information hiding.

### abstraction
- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
- Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces.

### information hiding
- Information hiding is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user.
- Information hiding can be achieved with access modifiers.

### polymorphism
- Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
- Polymorphism can be achieved with method overloading and method overriding.

### inheritance
- Inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties of one class by another class.
- Inheritance can be achieved with the `extends` keyword.

### encapsulation
- Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
- Encapsulation can be achieved with classes.

## Exceptions
- Exceptions are used to handle errors.
- Exceptions are used to handle unexpected events.
- Exceptions are used to achieve robustness.
- Exceptions are used to achieve fault tolerance.

## Threads
- Threads are used to achieve parallelism.
- Threads are used to achieve concurrency.
- Threads are used to achieve asynchronous behavior.
- Threads are used to achieve responsiveness.

## Generics
- Generics are used to achieve type safety.
- Generics are used to achieve type casting.
- Generics are used to achieve code reusability.
- Generics are used to achieve compile-time checking.

## Enumerations
- Enumerations are used to define a group of constants.
- Enumerations are used to achieve type safety.
- Enumerations are used to achieve readability.
- Enumerations are used to achieve code reusability.

## Annotations
- Annotations are used to provide metadata.
- Annotations are used to provide instructions to the compiler.
- Annotations are used to provide instructions to the JVM.
- Annotations are used to provide instructions to the processor.

## Java I/O
- Java I/O is used to perform input and output operations.
- Java I/O is used to perform file operations.
- Java I/O is used to perform network operations.
- Java I/O is used to perform database operations.
