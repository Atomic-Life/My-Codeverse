// Sanket has a string consisting of only 'a' and 'b' as the characters. Sanket describes perfectness of a string as the maximum length substring of equal characters. Sanket is given a number **k** which denotes the maximum number of characters he can change. Find the maximum perfectness he can generate by changing no more than **k** characters.
// Input Format: The first line contains an integer denoting the value of K.
// The next line contains a string having only ‘a’ and ‘b’ as the characters.
// Sample Input: 2
// abba
// Output Format: A single integer denoting the maximum perfectness achievable.
// Sample Output: 4
