<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>two types of analysis</h1>
1.Asymptopic analysis(worst ,best and average case)
<br>2.amortised analysis(analysis based on certain set of inputs, it like quick sort has worst of n<sup>2</sup>but is actually near nlogn because n squared inputs are generally rare)<br><br>
<center>the chapter deals with few nasty things like asymptopic analysis and different notations
along with two rules<br>1.Master's rule for divide and conquer<br>2. Master rule for substract and  conquer<br><font color="cyan">3.It comes with Method of guessing and confirming <br>
</center></font>
<h3>Master's theorem for divide and conquer
<br><center>T(n)=aT(n/b)+( n<sup>k</sup> log<sup>p</sup> n)<br></center>
1) if a>b<sup>k</sup> then T(n)=0( n<sup>log<sub>b</sub>a</sup> )

and much more,, read the above topics and its done!!!!
